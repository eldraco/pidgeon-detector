# Pidgeon Detector

A machine learning pidgeon image recognition software


# Plan of action

## Design and test

1. Search datasets of pidgeons
2. Search for the best image recognition NN architecture
3. Implement the architecture
4. Try with new images

## Implement in Raspberry Pi

1. Get the Rpi working with a camera
2. Get the image into a vector for the NN
3. Test with images from the camera

## Re-training

1. Implement to use the camera live as training image
2. Implement to tell the Rpi when to train and when to test (button?)
